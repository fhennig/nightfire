# lumi

A server and web client to control RGB lights connected to a Raspberry
Pi.

It uses pi-blaster to set the lights.  A web UI is provided to set the
lights, under the hood it provides a GraphQL API.

Various modes are supported.

  
## Builing for arm

    cargo build --release --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --bin lumi
    
## Build the Website

    cd client
    npm start build
    
Copy the contents of the build directory to `/usr/local/lib/lumi/web/`.

    
## System Dependencies

- pi-blaster
- nginx


## Installation

- Put binary in `/usr/local/bin/lumi`
- Put web files in `/usr/local/lib/lumi/web/`
- Put the systemd unit file in `/etc/systemd/system/lumi.service`
- Put the nginx file (`lumi`) in the correct place
- Put the config file in `/etc/lumi/conf.yaml`


## GraphQL API

The lights are controlled by modes.  At any time there is only one
mode active.

    mutation setLight {
      manualMode(settings: [
        {lightId: "light1", r: 1, g: 0, b: 1},
        {lightId: "light2", r:0}]) {
        ok
      }
    }

This mutation would activate the manualMode, and update its settings.

Different modes take different arguments, and arguments are frequently
optional:

    mutation pinkMode {
      pinkPulse
    }


## Internal workings

There is a light struct that can only be owned by any single mode.
The mode can then internally have a thread that continuously updates
the light.

Every mode has an activate and deactivate function.  These can be used
to start and stop a thread.  Any mode can also implement other methods
that mutate internal state.

zu jeder mutation f√ºr einen mode gibt es dann auch ein query mit dem
man den zustand des modes abfragen kann.


## Ideas

- Implement a midi mode that listens in a thread for midi signals.
- a "random walk" for color hue
- a "beat" function for light intensity
- a pulsating/heart beat function for light intensity
- a rainbow function for color hue


## TODO

- move the palette color representation
- implement query structure to query mode settings
