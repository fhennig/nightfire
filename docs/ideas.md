Ideas and TODOs for the future.

## New Mode

A new mode where both sticks are a "blob" that is moved around.  One
is red, the other is blue.  Can be a nice mix of colors.  Make the
controller very symmetrical, have one side for each blob.

I could have both blobs be controlled by different intensities, one
for bass, one for high hats or something.

## Light intensity normalization function

I need a function that takes a linear 0 to 1 value and somehow maps it
to values that look linear in the lights too.  The lights are very
sensitive from 0 to about 0.15 and not so much above that.
