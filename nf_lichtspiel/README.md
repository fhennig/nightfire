# Hardware Setup

The LEDs come with a power adapter that delivers 12V 0.42A ~= 5W.  The
Raspberry Pi 3 B+ requires 5V, 2.5A = 12.5W.  The total W required is
17.5, that means with 12V I'd need a 12V 1.5A power supply.

I'm using a 12V 2A = 24W power input.  Then I convert the 12V to 5V
for the Raspberry Pi.
